This folder contains all the datasets required for the Machine Learning Laboratory experiments and the mini project. 
Each dataset has been carefully selected or generated to demonstrate key machine learning concepts such as regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and ensemble methods.
Most datasets are provided in CSV format and are ready to be used with Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. 
They are lightweight, making them ideal for classroom and lab environments where fast execution and clear visualization are important.
