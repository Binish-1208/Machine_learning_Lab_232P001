This folder contains the implementations of different machine learning algorithms and techniques as per the lab curriculum. 
Each experiment is implemented in Python using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

**1. Fundamental Data Structures and Libraries in Python**
Implementation of NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn for data handling, preprocessing, and visualization in machine learning.

**2. Simple Linear Regression**
Building a regression model to predict continuous variables using a single independent feature.

**3. Multiple Linear Regression**
Designing a regression model with multiple independent variables for predicting continuous outcomes.

**4. Logistic Regression**
   a. Simple Logistic Regression – Binary classification with a single predictor variable.
   b. Multiple Logistic Regression – Binary/multi-class classification with multiple predictors.

**5. Decision Tree (ID3 and CART)**
Implementation of classification and regression using ID3 and CART decision tree algorithms.

**6. Ensemble Learning (Bagging)**
Applying bagging technique to improve accuracy and reduce variance using multiple weak learners.

**7. Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
Implementation of SVM for classification tasks with different kernel functions.

**8. Clustering (Unsupervised Algorithm)**
Implementation of clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means) for unsupervised learning.

**9. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
Dimensionality reduction using PCA to transform features while retaining maximum variance.

**10. Locally Weighted Regression (LWR)**
Implementing non-parametric regression using local weights for prediction.
